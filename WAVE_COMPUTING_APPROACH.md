# Wave-Based Computational Architecture: Approach Summary

## Core Concept
A self-modifying, signal-driven computational fabric where:
- **Signal = Data = Logic**: The wavefront carries both computation and reconfiguration
- **Flexible Timing**: Can operate asynchronously (signal-driven) or with optional clocking for FPGA compatibility
- **Spatial Computing**: Logic cells rewrite themselves and their neighbors based on signal patterns
- **Biological Inspiration**: Mimics protein folding, DNA computation, and cellular processes

## Key Innovations

### 1. Computational Wave
- Each logic cell processes data AND rewrites downstream logic
- Wave propagates configuration changes alongside computation
- Creates an "infinite pipeline" through spatial reconfiguration
- Self-sustaining computation that adapts to input patterns

### 2. Signal-Driven Reconfiguration
- Strong signals trigger local logic mutations
- Pattern recognition enables predictive reconfiguration
- Feedback loops allow learning and optimization
- Environmental triggers (like pH, temperature) can alter behavior

### 3. Applications

#### Protein Folding Simulation
- Each amino acid = logic cell with phi/psi angles
- Folding wave propagates torsion decisions
- Signal-triggered reconfiguration simulates binding events
- Real-time conformational changes through logic evolution

#### Cryptographic Factorization
- Wave-based modular exponentiation
- Period detection through signal interference patterns
- Potential polynomial-time scaling for large numbers
- Eliminates instruction fetch/decode overhead

## Mathematical Foundation

### Scaling Analysis
- **Classical CPU**: O(log³N) per modular exponentiation
- **Quantum (Shor)**: O(log³N) with QFT periodicity detection
- **Wave Architecture**: O(log²N) with spatial parallelism and signal-based period detection

### Periodicity Detection
For factoring N = pq, find order r where aʳ ≡ 1 (mod N):
- Multiple wavefronts run parallel trials
- Signal interference patterns reveal period r
- Physical alignment of waves indicates mathematical cycles
- No exponential trial search needed

### Resource Requirements
- **Logic**: O(B) stages where B = log₂N
- **Time**: O(B) per pipeline depth, O(B²) total
- **Space**: Fixed wavefront width, reuses logic spatially

## Implementation Advantages

1. **No Instruction Overhead**: Logic IS the program
2. **Massive Parallelism**: Spatial unrolling across fabric
3. **Adaptive Optimization**: Self-modifying based on data patterns
4. **Physical Efficiency**: Computation at signal propagation speed
5. **Biological Fidelity**: Mirrors natural processes like folding

## Challenges & Limitations

1. **FPGA Constraints**: Limited partial reconfiguration on some devices
2. **Timing Closure**: Asynchronous design complexity
3. **Verification**: Hard to test self-modifying logic
4. **Tool Support**: Standard EDA tools assume fixed logic

## Optional Clocking

While the wave-based computational architecture is inherently asynchronous, optional clocking can be integrated to:

1. **Simplify Implementation**:
   - Clocked designs are easier to synthesize and debug using standard FPGA toolchains.
   - Timing closure becomes more predictable.

2. **Enhance Compatibility**:
   - Clocking allows integration with existing synchronous systems.
   - Enables the use of standard modules like BRAMs, DSPs, and FIFOs.

3. **Maintain Wave Behavior**:
   - The computational wave can still propagate logically, with each clock cycle representing a discrete step.
   - Signal-driven reconfiguration and feedback loops remain intact.

### Clocked vs Asynchronous Comparison

| Feature                  | Asynchronous Wave         | Clocked Overlay            |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Signal Propagation       | Continuous, event-driven | Discrete, clock-driven     |
| Timing Closure           | Complex                  | Predictable                |
| Debugging                | Harder                   | Easier                     |
| Integration              | Requires custom logic    | Compatible with standard tools |

### Implementation Notes

- **Clocked Mode**:
  - Each wavefront step corresponds to a clock cycle.
  - Logic cells latch data and configuration on rising edges.

- **Asynchronous Mode**:
  - Signal propagation triggers computation and reconfiguration dynamically.
  - No global timing constraints.

This flexibility allows the architecture to adapt to different hardware environments and design goals.

## Potential Impact

- **Cryptography**: Could challenge RSA security assumptions
- **Biology**: Real-time protein folding prediction
- **AI**: Hardware that learns and adapts like neural tissue
- **Physics**: Bridge between classical and quantum computation

This architecture represents a fundamental shift from von Neumann computing toward spatial, signal-driven computation that embodies rather than simulates natural processes.
