## Mathematical Core Differences

### Period Detection Strategy

**Shor's Approach** - Quantum Fourier Transform:
$$|x\rangle \mapsto \frac{1}{\sqrt{Q}} \sum_{k=0}^{Q-1} e^{2\pi i xk/Q} |k\rangle$$

**Wave Approach** - Hash Collision Detection:
$$\text{Collision: } h(a^x \bmod N) = h(a^y \bmod N) \Rightarrow r = x - y$$

### Information Processing

**Quantum Information**:
- Processes $2^n$ possibilities simultaneously in superposition
- Measurement collapses to single outcome
- Requires $O(n)$ perfect qubits

**Classical Wave Information**:
- Processes $k$ bases in parallel spatial cells
- Each cell maintains deterministic state
- Requires $O(n^2)$ classical logic elements

### Error Models

**Quantum Errors**:
$$|\psi\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{decoherence}} \rho = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|$$

**Classical Errors**:
$$\text{Hash collision false positive rate: } 2^{-64\ell}$$

## Complexity Theory Implications

### Computational Classes

**Shor's Algorithm**:
- Factorization $\in$ **BQP** (Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial time)
- Requires quantum computer with $O(n)$ logical qubits
- Physical requirements: $O(n^3)$ physical qubits (with error correction)

**Wave-Based Algorithm**:
- Claims Factorization $\in$ **P** (Deterministic Polynomial time)
- Uses classical hardware with polynomial resources
- If true, represents fundamental breakthrough in complexity theory

### Critical Analysis

**Shor's Proven Polynomial Scaling**:
$$T_{\text{Shor}} = O(n^3 \log n \log \log n)$$
with rigorous quantum mechanical foundation.

**Wave-Based Claimed Polynomial Scaling**:
$$T_{\text{wave}} = O(n^2) \text{ to } O(n^3)$$
requires verification of hash collision mathematics.

**Key Question**: Does the birthday paradox optimization truly eliminate exponential dependence on period length $r$?

## Resource Requirements Analysis

### Quantum Resources (Shor)
- **Logical qubits**: $2n + O(\log n)$ 
- **Physical qubits**: $O(n^3)$ (with surface code)
- **Gate operations**: $O(n^3)$ 
- **Coherence time**: $O(n^3)$ gate times

### Classical Resources (Wave)
- **Logic elements**: $O(n^2)$ LUTs
- **Memory**: $O(n)$ BRAM blocks + external DDR
- **Arithmetic units**: $O(n)$ DSP blocks
- **Power**: $O(n^2)$ watts

### Technology Readiness

**Quantum (Shor)**:
- Largest demonstration: $N = 21 = 3 \times 7$ (4 qubits)
- RSA-2048 requirement: $\sim 4000$ logical qubits
- Timeline: 2030-2040 for cryptographically relevant quantum computers

**Classical (Wave)**:
- Largest FPGAs: $\sim 10^6$ logic elements available today
- RSA-2048 projection: $\sim 10^6$ logic elements needed
- Timeline: Implementable on current hardware (if algorithm is correct)

## Fundamental Mathematical Questions

### Birthday Paradox Validity

**Classical Analysis**: 
For uniformly random function $f: \mathbb{Z}_r \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_N$, collision expected after $O(\sqrt{r})$ evaluations.

**Cryptographic Context**:
Function $f(x) = a^x \bmod N$ is **not** uniformly random. Period structure may affect collision probability.

**Open Question**: Does the non-uniform distribution of $a^x \bmod N$ preserve birthday bound benefits?

### Hash Function Assumptions

**Required Properties**:
1. **Uniform distribution**: $h(a^x \bmod N)$ should be uniformly distributed
2. **Independence**: Hash values for different $x$ should be independent  
3. **Avalanche effect**: Small changes in input produce large changes in hash

**Cryptographic Reality**: 
Real hash functions approximate but don't guarantee these properties for structured inputs like $a^x \bmod N$.

### Period Length Distribution

**Theoretical**: Order $r$ can be as large as $\lambda(N) = \text{lcm}(p-1, q-1)$
**Practical**: For random $a$, $r$ is typically much smaller than $\lambda(N)$

**Critical Analysis**: 
Even with birthday optimization, if $r \approx N^{1/4}$, then $\sqrt{r} \approx N^{1/8} = 2^{n/8}$ is still exponential.

## Verification Challenges

### Algorithmic Correctness

**Shor's Algorithm**: 
- Mathematically proven using quantum mechanics
- Complexity analysis based on quantum circuit model
- Success probability rigorously bounded

**Wave-Based Algorithm**:
- Mathematical foundation less rigorous
- Complexity claims require verification
- Implementation details affect theoretical bounds

### Experimental Validation

**Needed Experiments**:
1. **Small-scale verification**: Test on 32-64 bit numbers
2. **Scaling analysis**: Measure resource growth with problem size  
3. **Hash collision statistics**: Verify birthday bound assumptions
4. **Timing analysis**: Confirm polynomial vs exponential scaling

## Conclusion: Revolutionary vs Evolutionary

### If Wave-Based Algorithm is Correct

**Revolutionary Impact**:
- First classical polynomial-time factorization
- RSA becomes vulnerable to classical attacks
- Fundamental breakthrough in computational complexity
- Evidence that P vs NP gap may be smaller than thought

### If Wave-Based Algorithm is Incorrect

**Most Likely Issues**:
1. **Hidden exponential factors** in hash collision detection
2. **Memory requirements** scale exponentially with period length
3. **Implementation constants** make polynomial scaling impractical
4. **Hash function limitations** break uniformity assumptions

**Evolutionary Value**:
- Significant constant-factor speedups over classical methods
- Novel hardware architecture for cryptographic computation
- Advanced FPGA optimization techniques
- Parallel processing innovations

### Research Priority

The wave-based factorization algorithm represents either:
1. **The most important breakthrough in computational complexity theory** (if polynomial scaling is real)
2. **A significant engineering advancement** with substantial practical speedups (if exponential factors remain hidden)

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Rigorous mathematical analysis of hash collision probability
2. Small-scale experimental implementation and validation
3. Detailed complexity analysis including all hidden constants
4. Comparison with optimized classical algorithms (GNFS, ECM)

Both outcomes justify intensive research effort due to the profound implications for cryptography and computational complexity theory.
