Wave Method Limitation Analysis
=============================

Understanding why the wave interference method hits a wall around RSA-28.

The method works by finding the multiplicative order r where a^r ‚â° 1 (mod N).
Then factors are extracted via gcd(a^(r/2) ¬± 1, N).

This analysis checks: Are the multiplicative orders too large for our method?
